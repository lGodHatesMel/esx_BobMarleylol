# esx_BobMarleylol
This is just a simple script where players can roll joints and it gives armour

Install : 

1. Add the resources to your resource folder like "esx" or what ever you call it

2. Add "start esx_BobMarleylol to your server.cfg

3. Import the SQL file to your database

I have made this so there is enough config options so people can change it to how they need/like it

Config options -
- % amount of armour each joint gives you
- Time to roll 
- amount of rolling papers you need to roll
- max amount of joint you can hold

Note: Depending on which script you are using and what you call your drugs
Then you may need to change the name of the item that is use to roll joints 
So for example 'weed', 'bagofweed', 'trimmedweed'

Dependency:

pNotify - (as of right now "pNotify" is needed for the server side of 'Rolling Joints' part.. i will update it once it stops giving me problem using mythic progbar on the client side of it.
